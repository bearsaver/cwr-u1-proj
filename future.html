            <h4 class="mt-4">After the Constitutional Convention, the trend of suppressing the slavery issue continued.</h4>
            <p class="mt-3"><strong>1820</strong> - when Congress was forced to address the slave status of new states, they again decided to compromise, and further pushed the addressal of the issue aside</p>
            <p class="mt-3"><strong>1831</strong> - when an influx of anti-slavery petitions were presented to Congress, proslavery representatives passed a "Gag Rule", which banned the discussion of those petitions</p>
            <p class="mt-1 px-4">This is an excellent example of the negative impacts of suppressing the slavery questions. Instead of addressing the clear tensions that resulted from the North-South divide, Congress opted to completely ignore them, allowing them to continue growing.</p>
            <p class="mt-4"><strong>1850</strong> - the Compromise of 1850, an omnibus bill, is passed to address tensions resulting from the admission of new Mexican territory.</p>
            <p class="mt-3"><strong>1854</strong> - the Kansas-Nebraska Act is passed, leaving the fate of the territories to popular sovereignty.</p>
            <p class="mt-1 px-4">Even though this legislation attempted to suppress sectional tensions, pro- and anti-slavery advocates flooded the states to sway the vote, and bloody violence ensued. This exemplifies the consequences of compromise and circumvention when tensions are already high.</p>
            <h6 class="mt-4">All of these compromise attempts failed to resolve tensions, and in 1861, sectional agitation boiled over, and the Civil War begun.</h6>
            <h6 class="mt-3">Overall, the Constitutional Convention began a faulty trend of suppressing the slavery question, which contributed to the buildup of sectional tension.</h6>
